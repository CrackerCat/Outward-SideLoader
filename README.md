# Outward SideLoader

This is the rework of SideLoader that will be replacing the old version as soon as Outward's next update drops.

It's pretty much done now. Feel free to start using it if you want, but note other mods haven't been updated yet for it.

* Credit to ehaugw for great suggestions, lots of help with testing, and developing the example Swords in the Resources folder

## How To Install ##
